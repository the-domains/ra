  This innovative double storey residence was built on a sloping block with a
  combination of zinc and CFC cement sheet cladding. It was designed to take
  full advantage of the magnificent views at the rear of the property.  To
  accomplish this, the east façade was fitted with floor to ceiling double
  glazed windows.  A plunge pool was installed so the client could enjoy the
  vistas whilst relaxing in complete privacy.  There is also an underground four
  car garage to complete this outstanding new home.
